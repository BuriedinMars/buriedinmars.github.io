## I lost my voice today

It was embarrassing I lost my voice this noon.
I haven't spoken to anybody since last Saturday and I don't even know what to talk with people.
Isn't pathetic an adult has none to share a single thing of his life?

I felt like living like a monk, just read books, watching baseballs, and lie in bed waiting for takeout.
